  - Install helm.sh and clone tool from https://github.com/TheProjectAurora/helm-data-tool. Then execte:
  - ```./helm-data-tool/bin/helm-data-yaml.sh -f dashboardA.json > dashboardA.yaml```
  - ```./helm-data-tool/bin/helm-data-yaml.sh -f dashboardB.json > dashboardB.yaml```
- Create the yaml file that will have the full dashboard by first copying over the contents of dashboardA:
  - ```cp dashboardA.yaml dashboardAB.yaml```
- Manually copy yaml list values from dashboardB.yaml to dashboardAB.yaml:
  - dashboardB.yaml:panels => dashboardAB.yaml:panels
    - Beware that this content might be very long.  
  - dashboardB.yaml:templating.list => dashboardAB.yaml:templating.list
  - NOTE: do not replace anything in dashboardAB.yaml.
- Manually change the values for all "id:.*" fields so that each are unique values.
  - Command how to get fields that should be changed: ```grep -o " id: .*" dashboardAB.yaml | sort | uniq -d```
